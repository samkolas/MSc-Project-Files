# MSc Project Files
This MSc project focused on training autonomous agents to carry out surgical tasks. Using a simulated surgical environment in Unity, a grasping tool was trained to act autonomously to complete simple to complex laparoscopic tasks. Different Machine Learning algorithms were used to train the agent, using the ML Agents toolbox provided by Unity. This repository contains all C# scripts used over the course of the project, as well as training graphs and the final report. As the scripts were linked to Unity, it is not possible to run the C# scripts independently. All details about the project can be found in the final report.
